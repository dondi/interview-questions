# Code Review Interview Questions
Code fragments for use in technical interviews. The main purpose of these fragments is to solicit code review feedback from an interviewee.

1. Fork this repository under the GitHub account that will perform the code reviews.
2. Have the interviewee provide code review feedback on one or more of the files.

If desired, the fork may be deleted once its usefulness has lapsed.
